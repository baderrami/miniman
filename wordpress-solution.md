# WordPress Docker Compose Solution for MiniMan

## Overview

This solution provides a Docker Compose configuration for running WordPress with MySQL, designed to be used with the MiniMan Docker management feature. The solution includes:

1. A Docker Compose file (`wordpress-compose.yml`)
2. Documentation on how to use it with MiniMan (`wordpress-readme.md`)
3. Instructions for hosting the Docker Compose file (this document)

## Hosting the Docker Compose File

The MiniMan Docker management feature requires a URL to a Docker Compose file. Here are several options for hosting your `wordpress-compose.yml` file:

### Option 1: GitHub Gist

1. Go to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
2. Create a new gist with the content of `wordpress-compose.yml`
3. Make sure the gist is public
4. Click on the "Raw" button to get the raw URL
5. Use this URL in the MiniMan Docker management interface

### Option 2: GitHub Repository

1. Create a GitHub repository or use an existing one
2. Add the `wordpress-compose.yml` file to the repository
3. Navigate to the file on GitHub
4. Click on the "Raw" button to get the raw URL
5. Use this URL in the MiniMan Docker management interface

### Option 3: Self-hosted Web Server

1. Upload the `wordpress-compose.yml` file to your web server
2. Make sure the file is accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
3. Use the URL to the file in the MiniMan Docker management interface

## Testing the Solution

Before adding the configuration to MiniMan, you can test the Docker Compose file locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing wordpress-compose.yml
cd /path/to/directory

# Run the Docker Compose file
docker-compose -f wordpress-compose.yml up -d

# Check if the containers are running
docker-compose -f wordpress-compose.yml ps

# Access WordPress at http://localhost:8080
```

## Complete Solution Steps

1. **Host the Docker Compose file** using one of the options above
2. **Add the configuration to MiniMan**:
   - Navigate to the Docker management page
   - Click "Add Configuration"
   - Enter "WordPress" as the name
   - Enter the URL to your hosted `wordpress-compose.yml` file
   - Add a description if desired
3. **Run the containers**:
   - View the configuration
   - Pull the images
   - Run the compose file
4. **Access WordPress** at http://[your-device-ip]:8080

## Customization

You can customize the Docker Compose file before hosting it:

- Change the port mapping (currently 8080:80)
- Modify database credentials
- Add additional services or configurations

## Conclusion

This solution provides a complete example of how to use the MiniMan Docker management feature to run a WordPress site. By following these instructions, you can easily deploy WordPress with MySQL using Docker Compose through the MiniMan UI.
